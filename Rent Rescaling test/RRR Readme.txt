Raulfin's Rent Rescaling

RRR is NOT an XML replacer, it is modified material and settings data. In order to use RRR, you need to manually apply it to the default XML. Applying it is a simple copy-paste replace process best done with NotePad++, or pretty much any XML capable text editor not made by Microsoft.

Copy-Paste
To make this a bit easier open both files and move RRR 

1. Open the Default XML in your editor, If you use MO or NMM v0.6 make sure to use the XMLs from PCaPP and not the ones from PerMa or it won't work.

2. On the left there should be several collapse boxes, collapse all main sections in Armor.xml, Weapons.xml and Ammunition.xml.Do the same to the RRR files.

3. Copy each section from RRR into the default files replacing only the correct section. Do not copy the full file over or you will break stuff.

4. Save the modified XMLs and run PaMa as normal.

Merge
If you use Difuse, congrats you win, if not copy-paste.
